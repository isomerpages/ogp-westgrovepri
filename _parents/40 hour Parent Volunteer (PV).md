### 40-hour Parent Volunteer (PV)

Parent Volunteer Registration for&nbsp;2024 Primary 1 admission is now open.&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Objectives

* To partner with parents who have a keen interest in registering their child in West Grove Primary School.

* To engage parents in 40 hours of volunteer work so as to be eligible for registration under Phase 2B.

### TERMS AND CONDITIONS

1. Child must be a Singapore Citizen or a Singapore Permanent Resident.

  

2. Closing date for registration will be on&nbsp;11&nbsp;March 2022, Friday. Late application will not be considered.

  

3. Selection is not on a first-come, first-served basis. The school reserves the right to select volunteers who are willing and able to perform their duties during working days and are able to meet the needs of the school. Interviews will be held for shortlisted applicants only. The school will not entertain any telephone calls made during the selection period in March. All unsuccessful applicants will be notified by email in June. The decision of the school is final and the school is not obliged to provide any reason for unsuccessful applications.&nbsp;

  

4. Selected parents must voluntarily serve and complete at least 40 hours of service in the school by 31 May of the year of the Primary One Registration Exercise. The school shall not be held responsible for Parent Volunteers (PVs) who are unable to meet the minimum 40 hours of service. PVs who have not completed the minimum of 40 hours by the end May of the year of registration, will automatically be disqualified from the scheme and will not be able to register under Phase 2B during the P1 registration exercise.

  

PVs who wish to terminate their involvement while they are in the scheme, have to email the school at&nbsp;[wgps@moe.edu.sg](mailto:wgps@moe.edu.sg)

**For a child who is a Singapore Citizen, parents must provide a scanned copy of the following:**

- Child’s Birth Certificate or Singapore Citizenship Certificate (if child is not Singapore&nbsp;Citizen by birth)

- Parents’ Singapore NRIC or Entry/Re-Entry Permit (if parents do not possess Singapore NRIC)

**For a child who is a Permanent Resident, parents must provide a scanned copy of:**

  
- Child’s Birth Certificate

  
- Child’s Entry/ Re-Entry Permit

  
- Parents’ Singapore NRIC or Entry/Re-Entry Permit (if parents do not possess Singapore NRIC)

For single parents, other relevant documents (eg. custody papers) are also required.  
ALL PVs will be subjected to balloting should the number of applicants be greater than the available vacancies during Phase 2B registration. In the event of balloting, Singapore Citizens will be given priority over Permanent Residents.
