<p><strong>Our Mission: Empowering Every Child to Flourish</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;We are dedicated to creating a culture of innovation and excellence
within our caring learning community, where collaboration among school,
family, and partners empowers every child to flourish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The word "flourish" holds special significance for us. It reflects
our deep belief that every child possesses unique gifts and talents waiting
to be discovered and developed. Our role is to provide the nurturing environment
where these gifts can bloom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>United in Purpose</strong>
</p>
<p>We firmly believe that education is most effective when it becomes a true
collaboration between home and school. When families and our school team
work together with shared goals, children experience the consistent support
they need to thrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The spirit of our school is beautifully captured in our school song,
which reminds us that "with one heart, one soul and one mind, with renewed
faith upwards we will climb. New heights, new hopes and new dreams. Together
we achieve as a team!" These words embody the collaborative spirit that
defines West Grove, where every member of our community works together
towards shared goals for our children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Whether you are a current parent, prospective family, alumni or
community partner, we invite you to be part of the West Grove journey.
Together, we will continue inspiring and empowering each new generation
of West Grovians to reach their fullest potential and make meaningful contributions
to the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Best regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Mabel Goh (Mdm)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Principal, West Grove Primary School</p>
