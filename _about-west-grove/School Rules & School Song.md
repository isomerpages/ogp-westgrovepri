* We must be kind, honest and gracious to everyone.
* We must protect our school property.
* We must be punctual for all school events.
* We must obey and respect our teachers and elders.
* We must queue up in an orderly manner.
* We must conduct ourselves well to uphold the name of our school.
* Students are to wear the prescribed school uniform and modification to the uniform is not allowed.
* Students who are Singapore citizens must sing the National Anthem and take the Pledge. Students will take the Pledge with the right fist placed over the heart.

* At West Grove, we march on with our peers
* Together we achieve through the years
* We build, we shape, we declare
* What we have, we learn to share

**Chorus**
* Wisdom and Grace
* We totally embrace
* With Wisdom and Grace
* We will win the race

* With one heart, one soul and one mind
* With renewed faith, upwards we will climb
* New heights, new hopes and new dreams
* Together we achieve as a team
