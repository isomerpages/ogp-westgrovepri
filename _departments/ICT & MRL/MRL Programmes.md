**2. MRL Monthly Readership Completion**

Every month, MRL will generate a report on the number of books borrowed by each class and individual pupils. The class and pupil with the highest borrowing rate for each level will be rewarded with certificates for their achievements. In 2017, MRL launched another award to reward pupils who show the greatest progress in the number of books read within two months. This serves to encourage reluctant readers to read more continuously.

To encourage pupils to read more and widely, OWL (Our Wonderful Library) together with the READ@School programme, bring Book Bugs II to the Primary 2 and Primary 3 in 2018. Pupils will have to design their own bug trivia and borrow 2 books from our school library to redeem a book bug card. Many pupils visited the school library to participate in this activity.

**3. Monthly Library Activities**

The OWL (Our Wonderful Library) had thematic displays and these displays come along with interesting activities such as word search and crossword puzzles for students to participate in. Students will get to know the upcoming themes through the morning assembly notifications and announcements made in the canteen TVs. Students can simply visit the library, read through the displays and win exciting tokens by completing the activities. Students will also get to read books related to these themes to widen their reads.

In 2018, we have themes as follows:

* Fantasy Fun
* Books to Movie
* The Secret World of Spies
* Think Green
* The World of Folklore
* Soccer Soccer
* Explore Sci-Fi
* Discover the World of Narnia
* Discover Big Nate

**4. School Reading Ambassadors**

A group of pupils is selected to be the School Reading Ambassadors. They are one of the student leaders in West Grove. These students attended School Reading Ambassador Workshops conducted by our MRL teachers. They will be leading the reading trend and takes on the role to promote reading among West Grovians. The school reading ambassadors will present a book review during morning assembly weekly and selected pupils will also represent the school to tell stories at the community library. The ambassadors also come together to prepare a thematic book display in the school library. In 2016 and 2017, some of the school reading ambassadors also took time to prepare book displays and shelf talkers at Jurong West Public Library as a collaborative effort.

**5. KidsREAD Reading Club**

“Children have unlimited imagination.
Reading helps them discover new horizons.
It sharpens yet blurs their boundaries for what is real and the impossible.
It helps children to dream.
I believe we need to encourage that
in the young.”
- Then- Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong speaking during the kidsREAD launch

**The objectives of the club are:**

* To leverage the strengths of various partners to create a reading programme for children
* To promote the love of reading and cultivate good reading habits among young Singaporeans, specifically children from the lower income families
* To provide an avenue for children from various races to interact from an early age
* To help enhance the quality of life of the children and their families

This is a new reading club set up in 2014 April for selected P1 and P2 pupils. KidsREAD Reading Club is initiated by the National Library Board and the club is possible with the support of NLB, our school leaders, committed teachers and most importantly our volunteers. Our volunteers and coordinator attended a training session at the NLB and are always striving to make each kidsREAD session a meaningful one for all pupils in this club. Every year, selected stories are made relevant with an outing and project. We have visited Gallop Stable for pony rides after reading “The Lost Horse”, visited Underwater World and Sea Aquarium to find out more about sea creatures after reading “ The Rainbow Fish” & “The Hermit Crab” and experiential learning for Pizza Making after reading book “Don’t Forget the Bacon”.

**6. Competitions**

 The National Story Challenge (NSC) Tournament is an original improvisational storytelling competition opened to students in all primary and secondary schools. The tournament hopes to promote eloquence and a healthy interest in language.

2017 is the second year West Grove Primary School participates in this tournament. A total of 39 participants from our school have taken part in this challenge. By participating in workshop sessions, participants picked up storytelling skills through theatre games and find new ways to express themselves via creative movement, voice training and improvisational acting.  On a deeper level, they have become more observant, learnt to think critically when evaluating current issues and hence expand their knowledge to help them in performing.

In 2017, we had 29 participants in the finals winning in several categories.

**7. Information Literacy Programme**

In MRL, we promote the importance of information searching and discernment.  It is important that pupils learnt important literacy skills in view of the different media resources available. Together with READ@School, MRL conducted SURE-vivor to promote information literacy to allow students to understand information sources and make careful decisions before using them for their knowledge.

During the school holidays, a Digital Information Literacy programme workshop was conducted for selected school reading ambassadors and InfoMedia Club members. Through this workshop, students understand plagiarism and recognise the consequences of plagiarism. They also learnt to select efficient and effective approaches for accessing required information for investigative and retrieval purpose.

**8. Books to Go - Mobile Library**

West Grove also collaborates with the National Library Board for students to borrow a wider variety of books. We encourage pupils to borrow more books, especially before the school holidays to read. With wider resources of books, the school arranged NLB mobile library sessions for pupils to borrow books from NLB in our school compound. This is made possible as our school made arrangements to help pupils register for NLB membership at Primary 1.

**9. Workshops & Book Talks**

During the P1 Induction days, “Raising Readers” workshop was conducted for P1 parents. This aims to help parents identify the child’s reader type and choosing a book for the child. The librarian will also introduce a variety of reading materials and eResources on NLB website. Parents can look forward to finding out more on ways to support their children’s reading at Primary 1.

Our school invites librarian from the NLB to conduct interesting storytelling session and book talks during the assembly during the West Grove Reading Festival period. In 2018, we invited the NLB to conduct Kids Lit Quiz assembly programme for the upper primary while our experience teacher conducted an in-house reading quiz session for our Primary 1s and 2s to encourage our children to find out more about various story books in our school library.
