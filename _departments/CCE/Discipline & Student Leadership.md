<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>
</p>
<p>In line with the vision “Active Minds, Gracious Hearts”, one of West Grove’s
strategic goals is to develop pupils to be morally upright and actively
contribute to the community. Education is never complete if it does not
develop a pupil’s character along with his mental faculties and physical
ability. Character development is integral to education and is fundamental
to the holistic development of our pupils. In West Grove, besides providing
explicit teaching of our six school values through our comprehensive life
skills lessons, schools values, leadership and social-emotional competencies
are also integrated and infused through all aspects of education in an
environment that is caring and open.</p>
<p>In West Grove, no pupils is left behind and we look into welfare of our
pupils. Should any pupil have financial, social and/or emotional difficulty,
the school will assess his needs and provide him with the necessary support
so that he has an ease of mind to learn well in school.</p>
