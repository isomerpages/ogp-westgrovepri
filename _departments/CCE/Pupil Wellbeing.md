<p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>In line with the vision “Active Minds, Gracious Hearts”, one of West Grove’s
strategic goals is to develop pupils to be morally upright and actively
contribute to the community. Education is never complete if it does not
develop a pupil’s character along with his mental faculties and physical
ability. Character development is integral to education and is fundamental
to the holistic development of our pupils. In West Grove, besides providing
explicit teaching of our six school values through our comprehensive life
skills lessons, schools values, leadership and social-emotional competencies
are also integrated and infused through all aspects of education in an
environment that is caring and open.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In West Grove, no pupils is left behind and we look into welfare of our
pupils. Should any pupil have financial, social and/or emotional difficulty,
the school will assess his needs and provide him with the necessary support
so that he has an ease of mind to learn well in school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pupil well-being committee also aims to raise awareness of the different
types of special needs in pupils and equip teachers with strategies to
handle special needs pupils in their classrooms. We believe that this,
in turn, will facilitate a smooth transition for the special needs pupils
who are moving from one level to another level. We work closely with the
parents of the special needs pupils so that they are able to cope with
the fast-paced mainstream school environment or move on to a special school
which best meets their interests.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>KEY PROGRAMMES:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>1. Lighthouse Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The rationale for implementing this programme is to reach out to students
who are often left alone at home after school with little parental supervision
as both parents are busy at work.</p>
<p>Through the many activities the teachers organise, we hope to provide
a conducive and learning environment for our pupils. They will be able
to know more about themselves and build up personal competencies, thus
playing an active role to contribute to the school and the community.</p>
<p>The program is a two hour session, twice a week after school.</p>
<p>Activities like sandwich making, cooking simple dishes, learning computer
skills, adopting good reading skills, learning about Mindfulness etc.</p>
<p><strong>2. Workshops – Self-awareness and money matters</strong>
</p>
<p>Selected pupils who are our Kindness Leaders will go through 2 modules
of the workshops to understand themselves better and how they can contribute
to the school and society.</p>
<p>Some comments by our pupils</p>
<p><em>“I learn to not compare myself to others because we are all different in our own ways. My favourite game is the price is right”</em> 
<br><strong>Jolienne Peh, 3E</strong>
</p>
<p><em>“I learn to not waste money and be kind to others. I enjoy the price is right.”</em> 
<br><strong>Cheyenne Peh, 3A</strong>
</p>
<p><em>“I enjoyed the games and vidoes. I learnt not to waste money.”</em> 
<br><strong>Dino Olivia, 3D</strong>
</p>
<p><em>“I learnt that I am valuable. I enjoyed the final chair.”</em>  <strong>Mikki Tai, 4B</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>3. Food Donation Drive</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Kindness Leaders who completed the workshops will organise a Food
Donation Drive for the Food From the Heart Organisation. Food items like
instant noodles, rice, canned food were donated by our parents and pupils.
Our Kindness Leaders will categorise accordingly and give all these items
to the Food from the Heart Organisation.</p>
