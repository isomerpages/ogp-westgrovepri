# National Education & Social Studies
**INTRODUCTION:**

Social Studies (SS) is a subject that encompasses the study of history, anthropology, civics and geography. National Education (NE) elements have been infused within the SS lessons to help pupils develop a sense of belonging to the classroom, school, nation and the world. Through SS lessons, pupils attain knowledge, skills and values to develop into a concerned citizen.

NE is a whole-school approach and involves students, parents, teachers and the community. National Education is part of a holistic education. It emphasises cultivating a sense of belonging and emotional rootedness to Singapore. NE aims to develop national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and instill confidence in our nation’s future in our students by:

* fostering a sense of identity, pride and self-respect as Singaporeans;
* knowing the Singapore story — how Singapore succeeded against the odds to become a nation;
* understanding Singapore’s unique challenges, constraints and vulnerabilities, which make us different from other countries;
* by instilling the core values of our way of life and the will to prevail, that ensures our continued success and well-being.
