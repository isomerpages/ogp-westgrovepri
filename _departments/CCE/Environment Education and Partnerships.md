**West Grove’s Partnership Framework**

**West Grove engages and collaborates with stakeholders, institutions and agencies to effect programmes that support our school’s vision, mission and values. Central in the framework is the West Grove student. Through our partnership with the various stakeholders, we seek to design purposeful activities and programmes to enrich our students’ learning experience in West Grove.**

**School Vision**:  Active Minds, Gracious Hearts

**Mission of WGPS Partnership:**

We seek to establish strong and sustainable relationships with our key stakeholders to fulfil the school’s vision, mission and values and to provide our students with a meaningful, holistic education.

**Principles of Partnership (R.O.C.K):**

* **R**emember the child – Place the child at the centre of all partnership conversations and activities to build partners’ confidence that partnership efforts are made with the child’s interest at heart.
* **O**pen to feedback – Good communication allows school and partners to be open to improvement which can be made after or during the project. Successful communication will ensure sustainability of the partner.
* **C**ommon purpose – It is important to remember the purpose of how partners can enhance students’ holistic development.
* **K**eep it real - Programmes must be aligned with school vision, mission and values and with consideration of work-life balance of school staff.

**Charitable Organizations**

To teach our students the value of helping others, our students are involved in activities to help the needy so as to broaden their understanding of the culture they live in and make them aware of the challenges people around the world face in meeting their basic human needs.


**Local Organizations and Schools**

* **Environment Organizations**
Through projects with various environmental agencies such as the National Environment Agency (NEA), National Parks Board (NParks) and Public Utilities Board (PUB), our students do their bit for the environment led by Environment Champions in each class.

* **Schools**
Our school seeks to engage and collaborate with local secondary schools and institutions to enrich the learning experiences of our students.


**Community (Values-in-Action)**

To instil in our students a strong sense of social responsibility, we partner with the community to create platforms for our students to work on various projects.


**Overseas Schools**

Our school conducts exchange programmes with the objective of promoting global awareness and developing cross-cultural skills in our students. Interactions with peers of different cultures enrich their learning experiences and create an excellent platform for them to practise communication and social skills.
