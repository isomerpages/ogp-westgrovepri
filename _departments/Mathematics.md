**INTRODUCTION**

Mathematics is the study of patterns and relationships. It is an excellent tool for the development of oneâ€™s intellectual competence in logical reasoning, spatial visualization, analysis and abstract thinking. Pupils develop numeracy, reasoning, thinking skills and problem-solving skills through learning and application of mathematics concepts taught in class.

In West Grove, we aim to provide a variety of learning experiences to help pupils develop and explore Mathematics concepts and apply them in a wide range of real-world problems.

**MISSION / VISION**

* To provide our students with concrete experiences to learn Mathematics concepts meaningfully.
* To inculcate our students in mathematical reasoning and communication.

**PROGRAMMES OVERVIEW:**

In West Grove, we aim to provide programmes which will help our students to develop strong basics in Mathematics concepts and skills in problem-solving. Besides, students will be exposed to real-world problems and hands-on experiences to learn Mathematics in an interesting manner.

**KEY PROGRAMMES:**

**1. Laugh**

This programme is held from Term 1 to Term 3 which aims to support the selected Primary Six pupils to learn Mathematics. Our school alumni who are currently in Secondary One will provide peer-tutoring to them.

**2. ACE**

In West Grove, we provide opportunities to potential students who are good in Mathematics to extend their cognitive abilities in mathematical problem solving.

**3. GOLD**

GOLD stands for **G**ame **O**riented **L**earning **D**evelopment in Mathematics which aims to motivate young Mathematics learners through games in the learning of Mathematics. It is held termly during recess and it involves all Primary 1 to Primary 6 students. Our students also get to collect stamps for their participation and exchange the stamps for tokens.

**4. ICAN**


ICAN programme aims to provide additional support to the selected students from Primary 1 to Primary 4 to help them to close the learning gaps in Mathematics.

**5.E2K**

E2K programme aims to develop critical thinking skills in top-performing Mathematics students to solve the problems.

**6.P1, P3 and P5 Mathematics Workshop for Parents**

Mathematics workshops will be organised yearly for parents of our Primary 1, Primary 3 and Primary 5 to brief them on the Mathematics syllabus and assessment. Resources used during Primary 1 lessons will be shared with the parents to give them an idea how the children learn Mathematics in West Grove. As for Primary 3 and Primary 5 workshop, parents will learn how to solve Mathematics problems through model drawing and heuristics. Parents will also be briefed on the use of calculators during the P5 workshop.
