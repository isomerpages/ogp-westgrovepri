<p><strong>Mission</strong>
</p>
<p>To nurture each individual to respect and love the environment</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>
</p>
<p>To arouse pupil’s interest in Science through first-hand experiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Curricular objectives</strong> (adapted from MOE primary science
syllabus 2023)</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Build on their interest and stimulate their curiosity about themselves
and their environment. Acquire basic scientific concepts to help them understand
themselves and the world around them. Develop skills, dispositions, and
attitudes for scientific inquiry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply scientific concepts and skills in making responsible decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appreciate how Science influences people and the environment</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Key Programmes:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>E-pedagogy lessons</strong>
</p>
<p>In this programme, students are empowered to be self-directed learners
using the SLS (Student Learning Space) platform and the role of teachers
change from the traditional dispensers of knowledge to facilitators of
knowledge. By transferring the responsibility of learning to students,
the programme fosters self-management and responsible decision-making skills,
ensuring that students take charge of their own learning journey.</p>

<p>Like its namesake, participants race against time to solve mysteries,
questions and puzzles to win the challenge. However, unlike a typical race,
the challenges students face are based on science concepts they have learned.
This challenge encourages students to apply critical and adaptive thinking
while actively contributing to their team’s success, ensuring they navigate
the challenge effectively.</p>

<p>This challenge is presented as a problem for students to solve using the
5I model (Identify, Investigate, Innovate, Implement and Improve). As a
team, students brainstorm, create and test a working solution for the challenge.
As students work together throughout the journey of the challenge, opportunities
will arise to develop their critical, adaptive and inventive thinking and
communication, collaboration and information skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Hydroponics (P3)</strong>
</p>
<p>This is a programme where P3 students will get to plant a seed and monitor
its growth using a hydroponics machine in school. The objectives include
the reinforcement of science concepts learnt in the life cycle topic and
a development of their global literacy to understand real world challenges
in the agriculture world in Singapore and the region beyond.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Enrichment programmes:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>E2K Science</strong>
</p>
<p>This is targeted for P4 and P5 students who demonstrate interest and ability
in Science. In this programme, students engage in scientific inquiry to
innovate experiments and/or solutions to problems. Through the process,
students can gain and develop 21st century competencies such as critical
and inventive thinking and effective communication and collaboration skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Science High Progress (HP) programme</strong>
</p>
<p>This programme is for a selected group of P4 and P5 students who have
exhibit good attitude, aptitude and ability in Science. The objective is
to extend participating students’ knowledge and understanding beyond the
primary science syllabus and prepare them for competitions such as Singapore
