<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Science is the exploration of what is happening in the world. It taps
on students’ innate curiosity to explore, predict and investigate science
in daily life, society and the environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In West Grove, the central focus is on scientific inquiry. Pupils develop
critical thinking skills through a variety of learning tools such as hands-on
experiments, group projects, trips to the Science Centre, extra-curricular
activities and other e-learning resources.</p>

<p><strong>PROGRAMMES OVERVIEW</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some of the programmes we provide for our pupils:&nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>Science enrichment at Science Centre</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ST(EP)s</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a programme catered for P1 and P2 pupils. The aim of this programme
is to inculcate in students an early interest and curiosity about the world
around them.&nbsp; Various science topics tied in with the English stellar
units are introduced through exposure and exploration. To engage the pupils,
interesting activities such as teacher demonstrations, hands-on activities,
games and quizzes are carried out.</p>
<p><strong>E2K</strong>
</p>
<p>The E2K Science Programme Singapore is a Science enrichment programme
for pupils who demonstrate interest and ability in Science. It is run by
teachers in schools who have been trained in the E2K pedagogy. The programme
engages pupils in scientific investigations involving advanced science
concepts. It aims to engage pupils in scientific inquiry that will help
them to develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions scientists possess
as well as to gain important 21st century competencies such as critical
and inventive thinking and effective communication skills.</p>
<p><strong>Science HP Programme (Science Olympiad)</strong>
</p>
<p>This programme provides the pupils with additional enrichment and extension
of the regular primary Science curriculum. It aims to prepare pupils for
Science Olympiad and other competitions.</p>
<p><strong>Science Fair</strong>
</p>
<p>The Science department has been organizing the WGPS Science Fair for several
years since 2013. The purpose of the fair is to encourage student interest
in Science by providing a platform for our students to showcase their creativity,
indulge their natural curiosity and heighten their sense of inquiry. Interested
participants form a team of two to four members and choose to delve into
either the Investigation Category or Science Toy Category. The selected
teams will be guided by teacher mentors and taken through the Scientific
Process. Within that process, teams raise their awareness on the rigours
of scientific exploration and their general knowledge. If the team has
chosen Science Investigation, they will get to test their hypothesis and
discover that the outcomes of many experiments are affected not just by
changed variables, but, more often than not, real-world factors. In this
way, teams broaden their horizons and may simultaneously deepen their appreciation
for the work scientists do. If the team has chosen to create a Science
Toy, they can apply their understanding of the concepts they have learnt
in school, thereby elevating their prior knowledge and higher-order thinking
skills. After that, the teams present their findings and learning to a
panel of judges. They also share their project with their schoolmates through
a recess showcase. This gives the opportunity for participants to develop
their presentation skills – soft skills that are increasingly becoming
essential in a globalised world. The school believes that this activity
can promote Joy of Learning as children can indulge their curiosity and
interest in Science. We would like to congratulate the winners and thank
all the teams for their effort in making the Science Fair a wonderful learning
experience for all.</p>
<p><strong>P5 Escape Room Challenge</strong>
</p>
<p>This is a new programme first carried out in 2020. Students have to solve
questions, puzzles and challenges using science concepts that they have
learnt from P3 – P5. Students work in teams to solve for the code to move
from one level to the next. Escape Room Challenge is an exciting and stimulating
programme where students have to race against time and complete all the
levels to win the challenge!</p>
<p><strong>Science Support Programme (Alumni)</strong>
</p>
<p>West Grove alumni and other student volunteers are recruited to provide
mentoring sessions for selected P6 students who need further academic assistance.</p>
