**INTRODUCTION:**

* Literacy is the ability to read and use written information and to write appropriately in a range of contexts. It also involves the integration of speaking, listening and critical thinking with reading and writing and includes the cultural knowledge that enables the speaker, writer or reader to recognize and use language appropriate to the social situation.
* With this in mind, the English department's main objective is to ensure the optimum development of our children. We believe that all children have a right to develop, grow and learn in a society where each individual is valued and respected; where each individual in turn, values, respects and contributes positively to others and the environment which we all share.

**MISSION:**

* To provide an enjoyable language learning experience through suitably planned activities.
* To provide opportunities for pupils to use the English language effectively
* To develop a love for the English language

**VISION:**

* To evolve a school where good spoken and written English language is the way of life

As such, we offer children a meaningful language experience by:
* teaching all areas of the English primary curriculum
* planning, preparing and providing teaching resources that integrate oral language, reading and writing
* catering to the needs of the differentiated abilities
* taking responsibility for the learning and progress of our pupils in the language
* organising classroom resources to provide a positive learning environment
* motivating our pupils to enjoy and appreciate the beauty of the English language
