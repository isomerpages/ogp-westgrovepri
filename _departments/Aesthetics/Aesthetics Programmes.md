**KEY PROGRAMMES :**

**1.Community Exhibition**

To reach out to the community on Art Appreciation, art exhibitions which showcase studentâ€™s art work will be held in the neighbourhood community spaces. Both parents and students are encouraged to attend and view these exhibitions, so as to increase their appreciation of art, as well as develop in them a habit of visiting art exhibitions.
