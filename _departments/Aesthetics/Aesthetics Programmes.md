**KEY PROGRAMMES :**

**1.Community Exhibition**

To reach out to the community on Art Appreciation, art exhibitions which showcase student’s art work will be held in the neighbourhood community spaces. Both parents and students are encouraged to attend and view these exhibitions, so as to increase their appreciation of art, as well as develop in them a habit of visiting art exhibitions.

**2.Online Art Auction**

In order to reach out to a wider audience, as well as to instill in students the importance of giving back to the society, in 2016, WGPS held its first online Art Auction. Through this Art Auction, students learn the concept of demand and supply that affect the art marketplace. They also learn about the needs of the community, especially the needs of their contemporaries.

The art pieces are works of our students, as well as students from invited schools. Parents and interested members of the public can go to http://www.whereartsgrow.com/ to submit their bid. Proceeds of the auction goes to organisations such as Children’s Cancer Foundation and Child Aid.

**3. Artful recess**

This platform serves as an avenue to develop our students’ creativity through meaningful art activities.

**4.Tuneful Recess @ Busbay**

This platform serves as an avenue to develop our pupils’ Confidence, Creativity, Entrepreneurship and Leadership skills through meaningful art and music activities. Such activities can range from mini recess concerts to handicrafts.
		 
**5.Aesthetics HBL Activities**

The Aesthetics Department has also put up links to some fun art or music activities every week for the children as part of family bonding time during circuit breaker. These activities encourage our students to be actively and creatively engaged in the arts during this circuit breaker.  

**6. Racial Harmony Day Commemoration 2020**

In order to nurture our pupils to be well-informed audience of the Arts, we incorporate elements of music into our RHD commemoration. This create opportunities for pupils to experience arts in our local culture.

Students created their own musical instruments during Art lesson and used it in a play-along session during our E-assembly.
