**MT Fortnight - Classroom Activity**  

  

During Term 3, MT Fortnight activities were held for students from Primary 1 to Primary 6. There were activities planned for the Tamil students and the NTIL students from P1 to P6 based on their caliber. As a result of this activity, our students are able to learn about the various Indian handcraft works and also about the methods to do those crafts. From these activities, students were able to be independent learners outside the classroom, which eventually led them to let out their inner talents.

**Cultural Camp**

  

The cultural camp was one of the activities organized in conjunction with the MT fortnight for the P4 TL & NTIL students. In this activity, students learnt why lamps were important for the Indians, specifically the Hindus. In this activity, the students learnt how to do some hand painting to beautify the lamp. They also learnt the art of drawing the Kolam and to also colour it and beautify it. By showing their involvement, the students were able to bring out their inner talents which made them feel happy.
