Our annual Mother Tongue Languages and Cultures Programme is designed to create an immersive and meaningful environment for students to learn and appreciate their linguistic and cultural heritage. This initiative supports the holistic development of students by connecting language learning with cultural experiences that foster identity, pride, and curiosity.

**Curriculum-Time Cultural Activities (Term 2, Weeks 3 &amp; 4)**

This year, students across all levels participated in a wide range of engaging, hands-on activities during curriculum time. These experiences were thoughtfully curated to deepen their understanding of their respective cultures while reinforcing the relevance and beauty of their Mother Tongue languages.

In addition to in-class activities, our P3 students took part in a dedicated Mother Tongue Language &amp; Cultural Camp, where they rotated through a series of immersive learning stations focused on cultural arts and traditions.

*   **Chinese Language**: Traditional Fan Design (中国扇) and Blue-and-White Porcelain (中国青花瓷)
*   **Malay Language**: Seni Anyaman (Weaving Art) and Seni Tembikar (Pottery Art)
*   **Tamil Language**: Making Pallanguzhi, a traditional game using seeds or shells

These authentic learning experiences not only enhanced students’ language skills but also ignited a joy for cultural discovery. By engaging in traditional arts and crafts, students developed a deeper sense of identity and pride in their heritage.

At the heart of this programme lies our belief: Language is not only spoken — it is lived, felt, and celebrated.

2025 Little Reporters Programme: Nurturing Digital-Age Journalists

West Grove Primary School's Mother Tongue Languages Department successfully conducted our Little Reporters programme during the March Holiday, where students enhanced their mother tongue language skills through hands-on journalism experiences.

Our students participated in specialised workshops where Tamil and Chinese Language learners mastered Moo-V technology, while Malay Language students created news content using Canva. A key highlight of this programme included getting &nbsp;our young reporters to interview our school leaders, including our Principal, where they prepared their questions in English and completed reflections in their mother tongue languages.

All student-created content has been showcased on our dedicated Little Reporters microsite, where the school community can access news stories, interviews, and creative content produced by our budding journalists. This innovative programme demonstrated our commitment to meaningful ICT integration in mother tongue language learning.
