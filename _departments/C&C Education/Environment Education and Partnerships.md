**Principles of Partnership (R.O.C.K):**

* **R**emember the child – Place the child at the centre of all partnership conversations and activities to build partners’ confidence that partnership efforts are made with the child’s interest at heart.
* **O**pen to feedback – Good communication allows school and partners to be open to improvement which can be made after or during the project. Successful communication will ensure sustainability of the partner.
* **C**ommon purpose – It is important to remember the purpose of how partners can enhance students’ holistic development.
* **K**eep it real - Programmes must be aligned with school vision, mission and values and with consideration of work-life balance of school staff.
