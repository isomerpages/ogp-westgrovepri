<p>At West Grove, assessment is holistic and purposeful. It goes beyond academic
results to support the development of every child as a confident learner
and responsible member of the community.</p>

<h3><strong>Assessment Framework</strong></h3>

<p>The school adopts a balanced assessment approach comprising formative
and bite-sized summative assessments.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Formative assessments</strong> support teaching and learning and
are not weighted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Summative assessments</strong> summarise students’ attainment of
curriculum outcomes and are weighted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For Primary 1 and 2, assessment focuses on formative practices rather
than weighted assessments. These assessments do not contribute to an overall
score. Students’ learning progress and achievement are captured using qualitative
descriptors in the Holistic Development Profile at the end of each semester.</p>
