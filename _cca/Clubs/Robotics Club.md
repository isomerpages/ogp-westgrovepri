<p>Robotix Club</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Our club is a place where imagination meets technology. Students learn
to design, build and program robots that can move, sense, and even think.
Through hands-on projects and teamwork, our members develop problem-solving
skills, perseverance, and creativity — all while having fun. At West Grove
Primary School,, we believe in our motto, “Wisdom and Grace.” Our Robotix
Club embodies this by using wisdom to think critically and grace to collaborate
respectfully as a team.</p>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<p>To nurture students’ creativity, teamwork, and problem-solving skills
through hands-on robotics and technology projects. Students will design,
build, and program robots to complete tasks in competitions such as the
National Robotics Competition and hackathons. Through research and presentations
on topics related to technology, the environment, and innovation, students
will also develop critical thinking, communication, and presentation skills.</p>
