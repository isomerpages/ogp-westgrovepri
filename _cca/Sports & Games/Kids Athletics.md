<p>Athletics CCA aims to develop students’ all-round athletic abilities through
running, jumping, and throwing activities supported by structured warm-ups
and drills. Our goal is to foster mental toughness, discipline, teamwork,
and a lifelong appreciation for physical activity. Based on students’ performance
and potential across these multi-skill areas, individuals will be selected
to represent the school at the National School Games.</p>
