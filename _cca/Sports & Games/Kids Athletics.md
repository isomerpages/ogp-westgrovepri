<p><strong>Objective:</strong>
</p>
<p>Athletics aims to provide students with the skills and knowledge associated
with running, such as warm-up and drills. They will be introduced to various
events including jumping and throwing. We aim to develop mental toughness,
discipline, friendship, and love for physical activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pupils who have met the standards for competition will be considered for
National School Games in February to April.</p>
