<p>The Girls' Brigade (GB) is a premier uniformed youth organisation dedicated
to developing every girl to her fullest potential. Recognised by the Ministry
of Education (MOE), GB focuses on holistic development through a structured
programme that builds character, leadership, and a spirit of community
service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a GB girl, you will be engaged in a wide spectrum of activities, from
learning practical life skills through badge work (like arts and crafts
and cooking) to participating in outdoor sports, team-building games, and
meaningful community projects. Our activities are designed to instil values
like discipline, responsibility, and empathy, equipping them with the confidence
to lead and serve in both the school and the wider community. GB is more
than just a CCA; it's a supportive environment where lasting friendships
are forged, and every girl is empowered to become a thoughtful, capable,
and resilient young woman.</p>
