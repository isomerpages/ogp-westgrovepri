<p><strong>Objectives</strong>
</p>
<p>West Grove Cub Scout Group develops students in an environment that is
intellectually and physically stimulating as well as provides challenges
for students to face and overcome.</p>
<p>Cub Scouts learn to manage themselves and take care of their peers. This
encourages Cubs to take ownership of themselves and grow through peer-led
learning. CCA sessions are opportunities for adventures, learning life
skills, outdoor cooking, games, craftwork and other Scouting skills – all
while Cubs make new friends. In doing so, they get hands-on leadership
experience.</p>
<p>Cubs earn badges as they go through the Cub Scout programme – namely in
Scouting skills (Progress badges), personal skills (Proficiency badges)
as well as commemorative badges for key area events.</p>
<p>As the first line of the Scout Promise reads, “I promise to do my best”
– West Grove Cub Scouts endeavour to overcome difficulties and do their
very best in all things and at all times.</p>
