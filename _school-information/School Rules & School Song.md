# School Rules; School Song
**SCHOOL RULES**

We must be kind, honest and gracious to everyone.
We must protect our school property.
We must be punctual for all school events.
We must obey and respect our teachers and elders.
We must queue up in an orderly manner.
We must conduct ourselves well to uphold the name of our school.
Pupils are to wear the prescribed school uniform and modification to the uniform is not allowed.
Pupils who are Singapore citizens must sing the National Anthem and take the Pledge. Pupils will take the Pledge with the right fist placed over the heart.

**SCHOOL SONG**
